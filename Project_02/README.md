# Data Analytics Project: Understanding commitments in Online Course Applications

## Overview
Despite a significant number of applicants, there is a notable decline in attendance at the entrance exams, with only half of the applicants participating. By analyzing factors contributing to this dropout, we aim to uncover insights that can inform strategies to improve the overall commitment to the application process.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to investigate the dropout phenomenon occurring between the application and entrance examination stages for online courses.

## Scope
- Analyze participant demographics and characteristics to understand if there are any correlations with commitment levels.
- Investigate reasons why applicants do not proceed to the entrance examination stage, such as scheduling conflicts, lack of interest, or technical issues.
- Analyze how communication channels are utilized to inform applicants about the entrance examination and whether there are opportunities for improvement.
- Identify any barriers or challenges applicants may face during the transition from application to entrance examination

## Deliverables
- Insights and recommendations to reduce the dropout rates between the application and entrance examination stages for online courses.
