# Data Analytics Projects for GED

## Overview
Based on the completion of GED training for two batches of students through free sponsorship, this project aims to leverage data analytics to evaluate various aspects of the program's impact, effectiveness, and participant demographics.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze data related to the GED training program to assess its effectiveness, understand participant demographics, and identify areas for improvement in future initiatives.

## Project 01: Demographic Analysis of Participants

### Description
This project will focus on understanding the demographics of students who participated in the GED training program. By examining key demographic factors, we hope to uncover patterns or trends that may influence participants' levels of commitment and engagement with the program. Understanding these patterns will allow us to identify which demographic groups benefited the most and pinpoint areas where outreach or support could be improved for future programs.

### Data Points
- Age
- Gender
- Socio-economic background
- Prior education levels
- Geographic location

### Methodology
- Collect demographic data through surveys and registration forms.
- Use statistical analysis techniques to segment participants by different demographic factors.
- Visualize the data using charts and graphs to highlight trends and disparities.

### Expected Outcomes
- Insights into the demographic composition of participants.
- Insights into how different demographic groups vary in their commitment to and engagement with the program.
- Identification of underserved groups or gaps in participation that need attention.
- Data-driven recommendations for tailoring future GED programs to better meet the needs of diverse populations, with an emphasis on improving outreach and support mechanisms.

## Project 02: Post-Training Knowledge Assessment
### Description
This project aims to evaluate the knowledge and skills acquired by GED students following the completion of the training program. . By analyzing both pre-training (entrance scores) and post-training assessment data, we can evaluate the effectiveness of the program in enhancing students' academic abilities and their readiness for the GED exam. Comparing pre- and post-training data will provide insights into individual student growth and the overall impact of the program.

### Data Points
- Pre-training (entrance) scores
- Post-training assessment scores
- Subject areas covered (math, science, RLA, Social Studies.)
- Student feedback on perceived knowledge gained
- Attendance and participation rates
### Methodology
- Administer post-training assessments to measure knowledge acquisition after completing the program.
- Collect quantitative/qualitative feedback from students regarding their perceived improvements in knowledge and skills.
- Compare pre- and post-training scores to assess individual and group progress across different subject areas.
- Identify patterns in knowledge growth, and correlate those with attendance, participation rates, and student feedback.
- Use visualizations to present the findings, highlighting any correlations between attendance, participation, and assessment scores.
### Expected Outcomes
- Comprehensive understanding of knowledge gained by participants, measured by improvements from pre- to post-training.
- Insights into subject areas where students showed significant improvement or encountered challenges.
- Identification of correlations between attendance/participation and academic performance.
- Recommendations for program enhancements based on assessment results and student feedback to improve future training sessions.

## Project 03: Feedback and Satisfaction Survey Analysis
### Description
This project will analyze participant feedback from surveys to enhance future training sessions and understand the participantsâ€™ experiences better.

### Data Points
- Satisfaction scores on various aspects of the program (content, teaching methods, etc.)
- Qualitative feedback from open-ended survey questions
- Suggestions for improvement
### Methodology
- Administer satisfaction surveys to all participants at the end of the training.
- Perform quantitative analysis of satisfaction scores and conduct sentiment analysis on qualitative feedback.
- Identify common themes and suggestions for program improvement.
### Expected Outcomes
- Comprehensive understanding of participants' satisfaction with the program.
- Actionable recommendations for enhancing future GED training sessions.
- Increased participant engagement through responsive program adjustments.
